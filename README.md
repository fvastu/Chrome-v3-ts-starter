## Introduction
ðŸš€ Welcome to the Chrome Extension Starter Kit, your express ticket to crafting amazing Chrome extensions effortlessly! This kit is more than just a templateâ€”it's a magical tool that follows the Manifest V3 specification, making your extension development a breeze. With TypeScript and Webpack working harmoniously, you'll have a fully functional extension up and running in seconds.

## Features
- **Manifest V3 Compliant:** The project structure is defined to comply with the Manifest V3 specification, ensuring compatibility with the latest Chrome extension standards.

- **Out-of-the-Box Ready:** The starter kit is ready to use immediately, allowing you to focus on building your extension without the need for extensive configuration.

- **Webpack Integration:** Fully integrated with Webpack, enabling efficient bundling and optimization of your extension's codebase.

- **Quick Setup:** With TypeScript support and predefined scripts, you can have a functional Chrome extension up and running in a matter of seconds.

## Configuration
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Open your preferred file explorer or terminal and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Install the project dependencies using the package manager Yarn.

4. **Adding Icons:**
   - Replace the default icons in the `assets/icons` directory with your own.
   - Update the manifest file (`manifest.json`) with the correct paths and sizes for your new icons.

5. **Customizing Product Name:**
   - Open the `manifest.json` file.
   - Locate the `name` field and replace "__MSG_appName__" with your desired product name.

6. **Going into Production:**
   - Build your extension for production. This process generates a `dist` directory containing your optimized extension.
   - Load your extension into Chrome by navigating to `chrome://extensions/`, enabling "Developer mode," and clicking "Load unpacked." Select the `dist` directory.
   - Your Chrome extension is now ready for production use!

7. **Additional Configurations:**
